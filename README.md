#Boston Housing Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing Prices dataset, which contains various features such as crime rate, property tax, and accessibility to highways, among others. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict housing prices based on these features.

Dataset
The Boston Housing Prices dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 506 instances and 13 features. Each instance represents a suburb in Boston, and the features describe various aspects of the suburb's socio-economic environment. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables if any.
Model Training: Several regression models are trained using the preprocessed data, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess their performance.
Model Selection: The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics and used to make predictions on new data.
Results
The final model achieved an MSE of 21.52 and an R-squared value of 0.71 on the test data, indicating that it provides a good fit to the data and accurate predictions of housing prices in Boston.
Future Work
Explore advanced regression techniques such as gradient boosting and neural networks.
Perform feature engineering to create new features or derive additional insights from existing ones.
Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models further.
Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
